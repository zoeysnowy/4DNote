00:00:02
time to wake 9c 6:30 yeah we make our own fresh coffee in the morning all smells so good so you see musica wakes up at 5:00 or 5:30 just we can read books and hang out in the morning and then he'll then wake me up at 6:30 my baby good yeah and then he leaves her work anywhere between like 6:45 and 7:30 depending on the day good you have it and I just wake up to keep him company in the morning because I'm nice haha I'm fine good did you make eggs for office suite I am much more alive after

00:01:15
I've had a cup of coffee I'm done Hank hold up do you want a jacket babe hey hey thank you thank you Oh Jimmy I City Hall - I write today hmm I'll lock it don't worry are you longing for me I've got my adult clothes on and my face painted on normally I wouldn't bother with makeup but I'm meeting a client later this afternoon and then I'm meeting a friend for drinks so I should probably look nice this is my little workstation Dada Dada Dada I don't know if you know it

00:01:52
odd I've talked about it in a couple other videos I'm a freelancer and I work from home and so every evening I write a list of things I have to do the next day this is my don't read it it's probably pretty sad so today what do I have I have two articles due and a comic do so I am just gonna do email first and then get started well uh it's almost lunchtime and I just realize I don't really have enough stuff for lunch see I guess Oh mostly just vegetables and stuff um look there's our wedding photo

00:02:29
so I'm gonna go to the store and get just raw fish for nobody so I'm gonna make rice now and then so in Japanese houses your floor slippers indoors now especially in the winter freezing cold and then you can go your shoes over here and then so unfortunately I guess every time you need you have to zip up and put on your shoes so that's why I don't really have shoes that lace up anymore because it's just way too much effort and Mikey looks like perry the platypus isn't awesome

00:03:13
alright no ski and I haven't gotten rid of our Christmas decorations yet because they're adorable so we what's called a Beijing style apartment which just means like no perfect building with super fancy security and it's typically a lot nicer and you have to completely get into the building stuff like that well I was going to get vegetables from the vegetable vending machine for my other comic but they don't have vegetables today boost it it's a weekday this is like the first time I've been here they

00:04:11
don't have anything so sad you and everything I bought was for less than 500 yen for less than five dollars and I just got bananas and a salmon for two lunches not a home and this bar they cleaned they put their plumbing stuff out at night and then the rest of it it's just a small little back-alley I just got home so cold out there and I got the mail but it was just bills and a newspaper we didn't ask for my keys before I forget okay oh it smells really good her ice is definitely almost done

00:05:46
cooking you how much time we got left all right no and what did I get yeah I don't you guys care this is just my like life in Japan probably rather boring bananas which is just like a pack of five or a hundred yen and then a raw salmon that you can specifically eat raw like you don't have to cook it and this is for nobody usually so I just put raw fish over rice and that's easy to eat so if you want to eat it as sashimi you need to look for this congee and this says sashimi that's that the way to

00:06:28
write in Japanese using salmon trout so salmon trout that you can use for sashimi and so that let just lets you know that it's safe to eat raw and this is just price per gram so 123 so this was about three dollars and fifty cents for a large thing salmon you and this is the stuff we like to use good old soy sauce little actually guys so I can put a little bit of soy sauce in there and since I don't like dumping all the salmon just I don't like that being soy sauce all over the rice and

00:07:45
that's how you make a dumb buddy it's it's really it's it's not that difficult at all it's actually very very easy at very very cheap just riding all day I actually get exhausted pretty easily so I need to mix it up draw comics every once a while edit videos things like that so right now I am editing a video of you and I speaking Japanese and it's so weird to see me speaking Japanese like I speak it I just I've never really seen a video of me speaking Japanese before so that's a

00:08:27
tad bit odd uh and yeah I'm still using Windows Movie Maker I'm gonna buy a program soon just I'm doing my research before it can make since I'm that kind of person it's 2 o'clock now I'm starting to get a little tired from writing and stuff so I'm gonna go running yeah I don't go running every day usually two or three times a week I don't enjoy running I can't run very far but I know it's good for me and I kind of don't want to die of like a heart attack or something else when I'm

00:08:56
like 45 because then no ski will be a hot single father girls will jump all over nights just whenever I get writer's block or get tired of writing I will go running and then I hate running so much that all of my motivation to write comes back and I can just come back here keep writing and keep getting stuff done even if it's really boring so that is my trick for motivation I have issues shoot I feel my rods it's like a sports drink it's really good pan this is the turn on spot so now I'm just gonna go home and I

00:09:37
can remember it's here cuz it's right next to here it's kind like a red gin vending machine except you just it's like the honor system you just put your money there in the head stuff yesterday I didn't have it today why does nobody have vegetables people like hate Wednesday what is this PAH I am going home now they ever earned more relaxing time and stuff and so I just walk and run part of the way back so it's like a good cool down yeah every time I pass these houses I think

00:10:10
I'm all in there but so this is what a regular Japanese neighborhood looks like there's this you can tell it's a good day because people have your laundry and they only do that on good days well I guess they do holy moly these are the gardens that stock the veggie vending machine but I guess they're just off today which is okay there are no deaf holidays I guess I just wanted fresh lettuce her cabbage so uh yeah I got back from running I wouldn't shower ate a little bit snacks

00:10:50
and I'm just working some more writing some more mm-hmm hi I just finished drying two comics I was gonna show you guys when I drew them but you're really nervous when that happens so now recently I just sketched them first then I inked them so I did these two this was um last night oh shoot I forgot to do the table her before I forget cuz I need to scan eason soon oh and then this was last night which is the reason I was hungover is Rios get picked up some wine and we got drunk and just snuggled for a long time and stuff

00:11:24
and I decided the meaning of life with chocolate and this is basically my life so I try to do between one and three comics a day I'll just move this high I try to do between one and three comics a day yay so since I did three today I can probably stop and go back to editing or writing or something like that I think one of my greatest fears is somehow my computer is going to get hacked or something like that although weird random music I listen to on YouTube is going to get broadcasted everywhere I don't think it would

00:11:55
actually matter just mmm oh honey so it's 5:30 now I'm just gonna go meet up with a client at coffee shop and then I'm going to meet my friend for dinner sensory risk is mandatory drinking party tonight you so yeah let's go Jeff's finishing no offense let's get a real camera yeah you hear that sizzling no scheming new foods are still hungry from ramen and stuff yeah oh thanks for the laundry you're awesome and cut they add to what I bought this for myself on Amazon to reward myself

00:13:10
for finishing up a comic book number two and I really love this artist and comic person what you doing baby no no we talked about this Oh on the lighter side of mostly we just eat dinner and talk and then read books or sometimes he translates my comics we're just kind of hanging out in evening until it's ready for bed this is just like our couple time waiting for bed and hopefully my hair can dry a little bit this is our you tumble or hot water heater and it keeps us warm in the night and it'll just stay by our feet and now

00:14:03
it's done and this has been the day in life of freelancer in Tokyo yay thanks for watching I hope this was interesting I don't think it really is but that's okay it is I'm gonna love it now so I'm gonna go to sleep and do this all over again tomorrow good night hey baby say good night to the camera oh man server no don't eat river come on right it's good job you
